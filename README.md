# Waste-Classification
The Smart Waste Classifier is an AI-powered web application that automatically categorizes waste into recyclable classes using deep learning. Built with a TensorFlow/Keras Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the system processes waste images through a custom-trained model that identifies six categories: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. The full-stack implementation features a Streamlit web interface for real-time image upload and classification, while the backend employs Python with OpenCV for image preprocessing, scikit-learn for evaluation metrics, and comprehensive data augmentation techniques. The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline—from dataset collection and model training to web deployment—providing an intelligent solution for automated waste sorting that promotes environmental sustainability through technology.
